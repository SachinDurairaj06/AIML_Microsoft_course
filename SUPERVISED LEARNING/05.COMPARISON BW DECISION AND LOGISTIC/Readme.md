# Comparison: Decision Tree vs Logistic Regression

This project compares the performance of **Decision Tree Classifier** and **Logistic Regression** on a given dataset.

## ðŸ”¹ Key Concepts
- Logistic Regression is a **linear classifier**.
- Decision Tree is a **non-linear, rule-based classifier**.
- Performance is evaluated using metrics:
  - Accuracy
  - Precision
  - Recall
  - F1-Score

## ðŸ“Š Visualizations
- Decision boundaries for both models.
- Confusion matrices for classification performance.

## ðŸš€ How to Run
```bash
python main.py
