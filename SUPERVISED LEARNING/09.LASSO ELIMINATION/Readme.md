This project applies **LASSO Regression** for feature selection.

## ðŸ”¹ Key Concepts
- LASSO shrinks coefficients of less important features to **zero**.
- Helps in automatic feature elimination.
- Useful for high-dimensional datasets.

## ðŸ“Š Outputs
- Selected features after LASSO regularization.
- Comparison with OLS regression.

## ðŸ“¦ Libraries
- `scikit-learn` (for `LassoCV`)

## ðŸš€ How to Run
```bash
python main.py
