# ðŸŒ³ Decision Tree Classifier

## Overview
This project applies a decision tree algorithm for classification. Itâ€™s designed to show how decision trees split data into branches and make predictions using simple yes/no rules.

## What I Did
- Loaded a dataset (e.g., Iris or synthetic)
- Trained a `DecisionTreeClassifier` from `sklearn`
- Printed the tree depth and accuracy
- (Optional) Visualized the tree using `plot_tree`

## Tools Used
- pandas
- scikit-learn
- matplotlib

## To Run
```bash
python main.py
