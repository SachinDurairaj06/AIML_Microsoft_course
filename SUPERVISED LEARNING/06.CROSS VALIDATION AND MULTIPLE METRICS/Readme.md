This project demonstrates how to apply **cross-validation** techniques and evaluate multiple machine learning models.

## ðŸ”¹ Key Concepts
- **K-Fold Cross Validation** and **Stratified K-Fold**.
- Models compared:
  - Logistic Regression
  - Decision Tree
  - Random Forest
  - Support Vector Machine (SVM)

## ðŸ“Š Outputs
- Mean accuracy for each model.
- Variance across folds.
- Comparison table of model performance.

## ðŸš€ How to Run
```bash
python mian.py
