# üîÅ Customer Churn Prediction

## Overview
In this project, I trained a machine learning model to predict whether a customer will leave (churn) or stay with a company. This is a common real-world business case.

## What I Did
- Loaded a dataset with customer data (age, contract type, usage, etc.)
- Preprocessed the data (handled categorical columns, missing values)
- Used logistic regression / decision tree for classification
- Evaluated the model using accuracy and confusion matrix

## Tools Used
- pandas
- numpy
- seaborn
- matplotlib
- scikit-learn

## To Run
```bash
python main.py
